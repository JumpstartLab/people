My software development skills continue to evolve and my learning will never be finished, and I love that! My goal is to be with a company that views coding as a craft and takes great pride in the quality of the code produced. The community that I look forward to being involved with is as enthusiastic about teaching and community involvement as I am with learning and sharing what I have learned. Being with a team that pair programs, believes in mentoring, enjoys having fun and works hard together while also encouraging growth is my ideal scenario.",
