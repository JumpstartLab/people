The premise of the app is to take shot location data and map it to an image of a basketball court to quickly identify shooting patterns for specific players. I also provided an API that gives users quick and easy acesss to shot coordinate data for a particular player, for example a GET request to the following uri: shotvizapi.herokuapp.com/api/v1/plays.json?player=kevin%20durant&season=2008-2009 will yield the court location of all of Kevin Durant's shot attempts for the 2008-2009 season.",

One of the interesting features that I worked on centered around giving users the option of submitting their credit card information during registration. This involved using the Stripe API to store a reference to the user's credit card information in our database. During implementation, I realized that Stripe's recommended credit card validation approach was conflicting with the logic for the optional submission of credit card data. As a workaround, I moved Stripe's credit card validation logic into the user model.",
